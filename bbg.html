<h1><FONT COLOR="white"> THE MAHABHARATA - One of the grest Indian epics. I have always been intrigued by the story of Mahabharata. How a women is not safe in her own house, how the family menvers end up envying their own blood, strong bonds of friendship, devotion. The character details are worth appreciating and I must admit that I felt a hint of dissappointment during certain scences and verses.The role of Draupadi is what stood out for the most. Her friedship with the enigmatic Krishna, marriage to five husbands, being born out of sacrificial fire and much more. If you want to deep study on her character then I would strongly reccommend the book - Palace Of Illusions by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. </h1>
