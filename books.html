<p><FONT COLOR="black" FACE="Distrampler"><b> This book is based on the life of Maa Sita from childhood to the day she went into the dephts of Earth. We always think that in Ramayan, Lord Ram has played such an important role and struggled so much but nobody talks about how Maa Sita had to struggle even more than him throughout her entire life and most importantly when she was abandoned by her own husband to live in a hermitage whilst she carried his sons in her womb. This story really touched my heart and taught me how to always be strong in the most toughest and twisted situations.The author beautifully portrays how love is a strong force for which we even put our life in danger. The author is Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni(please refer with the picture on your right.)</p></font></b></font color>  
<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>Some remarks from scholars, writers and reviewers :</p></font></b></font color>  
<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>‘Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni turns the Ramayana around by telling it in the voice of Sita … This inversion is a gift – it presents us a with a way to know an already well-known story better and to love an already beloved story more’—Arshia Sattar</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>‘This inspired evocation of the goddess Sita is an epic song of strength and solidarity told with joy and intensity. It brings to life the personalities and predicaments of the Ramayana’ —Namita Gokhale</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>‘Among the many, many Ramayanas there are now even—thankfully—some “Sitayanas”, but I know of none with the special magic that Chitra Divakaruni … brings to the telling’—Philip Lutgendorf</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>‘Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni’s Sita … is an epitome of courage and self-respect, showing a path for all women. While weaving a familiar story, Chitra provides deep and surprising insights’ —Volga</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>‘In recasting the Ramayan as a love story Divakaruni accords Sita parity with Ram, revealing her innate strength. By giving primacy to her thoughts and feelings this also becomes the private tale of Shri and Shrimati Ramchandra Raghuvanshi, two wonderful people who loved each other but who broke up. To readers well-acquainted with that tragedy of modern times, the failed marriage, it will appeal. The ending, however, surpasses all expectations.’ The Sunday Standard</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>‘Divakaruni’s retelling reminds her readers that the Ramayana, besides being a morality tale, is a love story at its heart’ Huffpost</p></font></b></font color>

<IMG SRC="palace.jpg" HEIGHT="400" WIDTH="300" align="left"><h1><font color="#DB7093" face="Polyamine">2. The Palace Of Illusions</h1></font></font color>
 <p><FONT COLOR="black" FACE="Distrampler"><b> This novel takes us back to the time when a bloody war was taking place holding under its grasp the very truth of virtue(Pandavs) and sinfullness(Kauravs). This is the story of the Indian epic Mahabharat in the voice of Draupadi, the ultimate epitome of feminism and feminity. How must she had felt when she was harrased and objectified in the open court, in front of her own husbands and then had to wander with her husbands when they were cheated out of their father's kingdom.</p></font></b></font color>
<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>Some remarks from scholars, writers and reviewers :</p></font></b></font color>
<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>“A rich tale of passion and love, power and weakness, honor and humiliation. Whether or not readers are familiar with the Mahabharat epic, they will enjoy this entertaining, insightful and suspenseful story.” (Library Journal, starred review)</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>“The Palace of Illusions by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni is as sprawling and bright a gem as the Hope Diamond – a mythic tale brimming with warriors, magic and trachery (and its brother, deceit)…. Who better to attempt the feat of transforming a centuries-old cultural icon into a personal, modern story than Divakaruni, a professor of English at the University of Houston and author of numerous award-winning works, including the luscious novel The Mistress of Spices and the bestselling Sister of my Heart.  Divakaruni’s sentences dazzle; the images she creates are masterful….”  (Los Angeles Times)</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>“Panchaali’s narrative provides a radient entrée into an ancient mythology virtually unknown to the Western world. Divakaruni’s impulse to flesh out the women of the Mahabharat results in a charming and remarkable book.” (The Houston Chronicle)</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>“Vivid and inventive. . . . rich, action-filled. . . complex.” (Publisher’s Weekly)</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="#BDB76B" FACE="Distrampler"><b>“Your truly epic narrative myth calls for bitter experience descending, avalanche-like, down dynasties, incorporating dramatic turning points of ineradicable impact; curses; looming fates; tricky and meddlesome gods; feuds; sages, sorcerers and wars. These elements and many more are found in abundance in Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni’s new novel, The Palace of Illusions, which ambitiously encapsulates the Indian epic “Mahabharat” within a 360-page novel.” (San Francisco Chronicle)</p></font></b></font color>

<p><FONT COLOR="black" FACE="Distrampler"><b> We are aware of a number of customs and traditions of our religion but most of all are not aware of the exact facts that lie beyond our basic imagination, or the things which we are told about is counterfactual or half true. So to know the exact facts about hindu mythology, this book is the perfect book for your curious mind. It takes you to the depths of hindu mythology. Hindu mythology refers to a vast body of ancient stories, beliefs, and traditions that have evolved over thousands of years in the Indian subcontinent. These myths encompass many gods, goddesses, heroes, and creatures and are integral to Hindu religion and culture. Some of the most well-known Hindu myths include the creation story of the god Brahma, the tales of Vishnu and his avatars (incarnations), and the God Shiva. These stories also have numerous stories of divine and demonic beings and multiple cosmologies and explanations for the origins of life and the universe. Also, some of these stories can provide individuals with a deeper connection to the divine, resulting in spiritual enrichment. The stories are written in straightforward language, which beginners and children can read. The narrative moves continuously, naturally, and seamlessly across the four yugas; this is fascinating. The font size is comfortable, and the contents and details of each tale’s characters are appreciable. This book provides an insightful journey into a magical world with mysticism, spirituality, and divinity. Reading these curated stories can be an enriching experience that provides insight into Hindu culture, religion, and philosophy. Apart from the superficial layer of experience, these stories have moral lessons and teachings that can help individuals develop a solid ethical and moral code. The book is fairly long, 436 pages, but the chapters are short and well-written. The chapter length works both in favour and against the book. While the short length ensures the reader’s interest, a few chapters ended abruptly and required more detailed writing to give it depth. </p></font></b></font color><br>





<IMG SRC="bhagvad.jpg" HEIGHT="400" WIDTH="300" align="left"><h1><font color="#DB7093" face="Polyamine">4. Bhagvad Gita : As it is</h1></font></font color> 
<p><FONT COLOR="black" FACE="Distrampler"><b>The Bhagavad-gita is universally renowned as the jewel of India's spiritual wisdom. Spoken by Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His intimate disciple Arjuna, the Gita's seven hundred concise verses provide a definitive guide to the science of self realization. No other philosophical or religious work reveals, in such a lucid and profound way, the nature of consciousness, the self, the universe and the Supreme.
Bhagavad Gita was told by Lord Krishna to Arjuna as an advise of what’s right and wrong when Arjuna was hesitant to go to war against his own cousins, the Kauravas. The events that led to this war are described in the Mahabharata, a 200 thousand verses long epic by sage Vyasa. Bhagavad Gita is a 700 verse epic divided into 18 chapters.<br>

Bhagavad Gita talks about various paths to spirituality such as the right action (Karma Yoga), devotion (Bhakti Yoga), and knowledge (Jnana Yoga).The Bhagavad Gita encourages us to live life with purity, strength, discipline, honesty, kindness and integrity. In this way we can find our purpose and live it fully. Just as Krishna urges Arjuna to cast aside all doubts and trust in his highest Self, we too can use the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita to meet our own difficulties and decisions with fearlessness and honesty, and learn to live life authentically and fully. <br>
The whole story of the Bhagavad Gita takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, upon which two sides of a family – the Pandavas and the Kauravas – are preparing for battle. The text itself focuses on a conversation between two characters: Krishna and Arjuna. 

Like many other writings of this period such as the Upanishads and the Dhammapada, the Bhagavad Gita or ‘Song of The Lord’ seems timeless. Its story is relevant whether we lived a thousand years ago, or we’re living in the modern age. We explore what happens when Arjuna has to make difficult, life-changing decisions – specifically the decision as to whether he should battle against his own family members in a war of ‘good’ versus ‘evil’ – and the importance of living a life of truth and purpose. 

The most interesting and often misunderstood aspect of the Bhagavad Gita is that it’s entirely representational and highly symbolic. There is no actual battlefield or fight to be won. The entire text represents the battle that goes on in our minds. It is about understanding how we can overcome difficulty, self-doubt, and ultimately live a life of truth and purpose.   <br>








The characters
In order to get the most from the text, it’s important to understand what each character represents:
<ul type=bullet >
<li>Arjuna: us in our human form, with all our doubts, worries and habits…. He represents you and I as we stand on the battlefield of life facing all the different parts of ourselves that prevent us from realising our true nature.</li>
<li>Krishna: the ‘higher Self’ or ‘divine’.<li>
<li>The Pandavas: the great virtues within us.</li>
<li>The Kauravas: the opposing forces within us.</li>
<li>The Chariot: our physical body.</li>
<li>The Horses: our 5 senses that need to be guided by the Self so we can realise our true nature.</li>
</ul>
